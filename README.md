# JavaScript Null Check Best Practice

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error:  failure to properly handle null or undefined values.  The `bug.js` file shows an example of how to gracefully handle null inputs, preventing common errors.

The `bugSolution.js` file mirrors the initial example, but provides a more robust solution if null values aren't desired for a given operation.  This is often an overlooked, but crucial aspect of defensive programming in JavaScript.
